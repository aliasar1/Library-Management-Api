# Library Management System API

## Overview

This project implements a robust Library Management System API using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The API offers functionalities to manage admins, books, customers, genres, issued books, and returned books. It utilizes JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aliasar1/Library-Management-Api.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd library-management-api
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and define the following variables:

   ```
   MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_uri>
   JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret>
   ```

   Replace `<your_mongodb_uri>` with your MongoDB connection string and `<your_jwt_secret>` with a secret key for JWT authentication.

## Usage

### Running the API

Start the API server using either of the following commands:

- Development mode (with nodemon):

  ```bash
  npm run dev
  ```

- Production mode:

  ```bash

The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:8010`.
